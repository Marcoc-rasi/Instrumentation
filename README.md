# Instrumentation

I did various projects, mostly circuits, and a final project, of an automatic cat door, programmed with Arduino. The repository has the appropriate documentation to be able to carry out the projects on your own.

# cat door

It consists of an automatic door for cats. Some important points about the content of this folder are:
- The Puerta_de_Gato.ino file contains the source code of the program that is loaded into the Arduino. The code also includes explanatory comments about each part of the program.
- The Puerta_de_Gato.pdf file contains the written report of the project, which describes its objective, materials, design, operation and results. The report also includes images, diagrams, and tables that illustrate the project.
- The folder contains the photographs that were taken during development. The pictures show the assembly of the components, the electrical circuit.
- The Diagrams folder contains the Proteus files that were used to create the electrical circuit diagrams and wiring diagrams. These files can be opened with the proteus program, which is an electronic circuit design tool.

# plethysmograph

This folder contains the files related to the plethysmography project, which consists of measuring the heart rate with electrodes. The electrodes are connected to a circuit that amplifies and filters the electrical signal generated by the heart. The signal is then sent to an LM3914, which is an integrated circuit that can drive 10 LEDs to display the signal as a bar or a dot. The LM3914 has an internal voltage reference and a precise 10-stage divider, allowing you to adjust the scale and sensitivity of the display. The objective of this project is to use the LM3914 as a simple and cheap oscilloscope to observe the heart rate.
# electr microphone
The operation of an electret microphone is explained, a type of microphone that uses an electretized diaphragm to capture sound. The document describes the components and circuitry of the microphone. It also shows how the calculations for the amplifiers were done. The document is a practical guide for mounting and testing the electret microphone.

#MOC3012

A circuit that turns on a 100w AC powered light bulb through an optocoupler and a button connected to DC

# Non-inverting amplifier

It is the non-inverting amplifier, which is an electronic circuit that amplifies the input signal without changing its polarity. The non-inverting amplifier has several advantages, such as high input impedance, low output impedance, good stability, and easy gain adjustment. It is used in applications such as filters, oscillators, signal generators, and control systems.
